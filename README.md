Assumptions we made in our code: 
  In order to pass values between classes we used a messenger class that allowed us an easier time sending and receiving relevant data for the require functions. 
  
  Additionally, we use a scheduler when evaluating our invenvtory, this helps to keep our code clean and functional as it takes away the need for excessive statements.
